## Contributing

Steps to contribute:

1.  Find a user story, feature, or bug that you would like to work on in the [Trello development backlog](https://trello.com/b/Wv349ITE/fragmented-development-backlog).

2.  Let me know that you would like to work on that feature, and chat about the design and requirements on Trello, or elsewhere if needed. Until the backend is built out in IPFS or swarm, only I can make changes to the backend. I will need to complete any backend changes that need to made for the feature, and then front end work can begin.

3.  Submit a pull request with the link to the Trello card.

Pull requests are welcome. File an issue for ideas, conversation or feedback.
